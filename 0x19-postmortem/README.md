POSTMORTEM REPORT
Issue Summary
Duration: The outage occurred on Aug 08, 2024, from 2:30 PM to 3:45 PM WAT.
Impact: The primary web service was down, affecting the login and payment processing functionalities. Users experienced 502 Bad Gateway errors when trying to access the site. Approximately 75% of our user base was affected.
Root Cause: The root cause was a misconfigured Nginx server that failed to properly communicate with the backend application servers due to a recent update that introduced compatibility issues.
Timeline
2:30 PM: Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating increased error rates and response times.
2:32 PM: Engineers began investigating the alerts and checking logs for anomalies.
2:40 PM: Initial assumption was a database overload, and database performance was checked.
2:50 PM: Investigation showed no signs of database issues; focus shifted to application servers.
3:00 PM: Noticed misleading logs suggesting network connectivity issues.
3:10 PM: Escalated to the network operations team for further investigation.
3:20 PM: Network team found no issues; escalated to the application infrastructure team.
3:30 PM: Application infrastructure team identified a recent Nginx update as the potential cause.
3:40 PM: Rolled back the Nginx update to the previous stable version.
3:45 PM: Issue resolved, and services fully restored.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The incident was caused by a misconfigured Nginx server due to a recent update. The update introduced compatibility issues with the backend application servers, leading to failed communications and resulting in 502 Bad Gateway errors for users.
Resolution: The resolution involved rolling back the Nginx server to the previous stable version. This rollback restored proper communication between Nginx and the backend servers, resolving the outage and restoring service functionality.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:
Improve the update and deployment process to include comprehensive compatibility testing.
Enhance monitoring to detect communication issues between Nginx and backend servers more quickly.
